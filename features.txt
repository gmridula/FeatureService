App Mesh separates the logic needed for monitoring and controlling communications into a proxy that manages all network traffic for each service. The proxy standardizes how your services communicates and removes the need to coordinate across teams or update application code to change how monitoring data is collected or traffic is routed. App Mesh configures each proxy to export monitoring data and implement communications control logic for every service. -Consistent microservice communications
App Mesh uses the open source Envoy proxy to manage all traffic into and out of a service’s containers. App Mesh configures this proxy to automatically handle all of the service’s application communications. -Open source proxy
App Mesh lets you configure services to connect directly to each other instead of requiring code within the application or using a load balancer. -Traffic Control
